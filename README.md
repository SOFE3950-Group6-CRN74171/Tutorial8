### Notice
It is recommended for this lab activity and others that you save/bookmark the following resources as they are very useful for C programming.
- [http://en.cppreference.com/w/c](http://en.cppreference.com/w/c)
- [http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/)

The following resources are helpful as you will need to use signals and data structures to complete the task.

### Conceptual Questions
1. What is an Abstract Data Type (ADT)?
2. Explain the difference between a queue (FIFO) and a stack (LIFO).
3. Name and briefly explain three types of data structures.
4. Explain what a binary tree is, what are some common operations of a binary tree?
5. Explain what a hash table (dictionary) is, what are common operations of a hash table?

### Application Questions

All of your programs for this activity can be completed using the template provided, where you fill in the remaining content. A makefile is not necessary, to compile your programs use the following command in the terminal. If you do not have clang then replace clang with gcc, if you are still having issues please use -std=gnu99 instead of c99.

```bash
clang -Wall -Wextra -std=c99 <program name>.c -o <program name>
```
## Notice

You must have the program process in the same location as your source code, compile the included source file sigtrap.c as process using the following commands. You can use clang or gcc, you will need to use -std=gnu99 in order for the code to compile properly.

1. Create a program that does the following:
   - Create a structure called proc that contains the following:
     - parent, character array of 256, name of the parent process
     - name, character array of 256 length
     - priority, integer for the process priority
     - memory, integer for the memory in MB used by process
   - Create a binary tree data structure called proc_tree which contains the proc data structure.
   - Create the necessary functions to interact with your binary tree data structure, you will need to add items to your tree and iterate through it.
   - Your program then reads the contents of a file called process_tree.txt (7 LINES), which contains a comma separated list of the parent, name, priority, and memory.
   - Read the contents of the file and create your binary tree, add the children to the parent based on the name of the parent.
   - Print the contents of your binary tree (you likely need to use recursion!) displaying the contents of each parent, and the children of each parent.

2. Create a simple host dispatch shell that does the following:
   - Create a structure called proc that contains the following:
     - name, character array of 256 length
     - priority, integer for the process priority
     - pid, integer for the process id
     - address integer index of memory in avail_mem allocated
     - memory, integer for the memory required
     - runtime, integer for the running time in seconds
     - suspended, boolean indicating process has been suspended
   - Create a FIFO queue called priority which will be populated with real time priority processes (priority 0).
   - Create a second FIFO queue called secondary, which will be populated with secondary priority processes.
   - Create an array of length 1024 called avail_mem, use #define MEMORY 1024, initialize it to 0 to indicate all memory is free.
   - Read in the processes from the file processes_q2.txt, the file contains a comma separated list of the name, priority, memory, and runtime you must initialize the pid and address to 0 in your process structure, it is set when you execute the processes.
   - When reading the file processes_q2.txt add each process with a priority of 0 to the priority queue, add the remaining processes to the secondary queue.
   - Iterate through all of the processes in the priority queue first, pop() each item from the queue and execute the process binary using fork and exec.
   - Mark the memory needed in the avail_mem array as used (1), set the address member of the struct to the starting index where the memory is allocated in the avail_mem array.
   - Before process is executed, print the name, priority, pid, memory, and runtime of the process.
   - Run the process for the specified runtime and then send it the signal SIGTSTP to terminate it.
   - Ensure that you use the waitpid function to wait until the process has terminated.
   - Free the memory in avail_mem used by the process (set the array entries to 0).
   - Then iterate through all of the processes in the secondary queue, pop() each item from the queue and execute the process binary using fork and exec.
   - If there is enough memory available in avail_mem array then proceed, otherwise push() it back on the queue.
   - Mark the memory needed in the avail_mem array as used (1), set the address member of the struct to the starting index where the memory is allocated in the avail_mem array.
   - Before process is executed, print the name, priority, pid, memory, and runtime of the process.
   - If the process has already been suspended (suspended is true, and pid set) then send SIGCONT to the process to resume it.
   - Run the process for 1 second then send SIGTSTP to the process to suspend it.
   - If the process was just created, set the pid member in the process struct that was returned from pop() to the process id returned from exec().
   - Decrement the runtime member in the process struct by 1.
   - Set the suspended member in the process struct to true, indicating the processes has been suspended.
   - Add the process back to the secondary queue using push().
   - Repeat this for every process in the secondary queue.
   - For any item in the secondary queue that only has 1 second of runtime left:
     - Run the process for the specified runtime and then send it the signal SIGINT to terminate it.
     - Ensure that you use the waitpid function to wait until the process has terminated.
     - Do not add the process back to the queue.
     - Free the memory in avail_mem used by the process (set the array entries to 0).
   - Once all of the processes have been executed, the main program terminates.
